# JavaScript-Interactive Visualizations and Dashboards

## Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

### Step 1 - Plotly.js

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.

* Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.
* Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.
* Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`
* Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page
* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
